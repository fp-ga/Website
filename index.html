        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <p>This to my page I do random stuff and try to get the hang of Webdev here. Please don't expect anything and you wont be dissaponted</p>

        <h2>This is a subtitle</h2>
        <p>I put this here so I can see what it looks like. If you don't find this interesting don't read it lol. I just decided to write a longer text here so I can see what it looks like. YOu could theoretically treat this like a lorem ipsum text but in english. I decided to write in english becaus ei don't actually know what lorem ipsum translates to and generally am not fluent in latin(yet). If you are reading this anyway you are probably procrastinating and should get back to work. Anyway I will write some more words here so it looks alittle better. Some words could be this for example. It could also just be a list of animals however i sadly don't know enough animals for that i'm afraid.</p>
